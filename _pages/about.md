I received my bachelor's degree from the <a href='https://speit.sjtu.edu.cn/en'>SJTU-Paris Elite Institute of Technology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, majoring in French with a minor in Information Engineering.

I have been admitted to the <a href='https://mscac.utoronto.ca/'>Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC) program at the University of Toronto</a>, with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. However, my enrollment has been delayed due to study permit application issues.

My research interests include computer vision and embodied intelligence, robotic manipulation and locomotion.
